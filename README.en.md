# LCSC Android ERP

Native Android app for LCSC component inventory workflows. The project is built for small offline-friendly warehouse scenarios and covers scanned inbound, manual inbound, storage location management, inventory search, BOM matching, QR label export, and local backup/restore.

## Features

- Scan inbound: parse LCSC QR payloads and look up material data by `pc`
- Manual inbound: search LCSC catalog entries by keyword and confirm inbound
- Location management: edit location code, name, color, and item sort rules
- Inventory management: inspect location items, edit quantity, transfer, and delete
- BOM search: import Excel BOM files, review matched / unmatched rows, and inbound directly
- QR label export: preview a material QR label and save it to the system gallery
- Import / export: back up and restore inventory data with Excel files
- Localization: switch between Chinese and English

- Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- MVVM + Repository
- Room + SQLite
- DataStore
